Hi! Welcome to the homepage of mine. I'm pursuing my Master's degree of CS at UCSD. Before that, I earned my bachelor's of CS at SJTU.

Know me through the following keywords:

## Programmer
With the career goal to be a software engineer, I'm currently on the way. See more projects which I have ever done at CV/Projects.

## Photographer
Use the images to capture the moments. I have went over most parts of China and several other places for trips with my camera. Invitation to those [beautiful memories](https://dreamy-dubinsky-6503df.netlify.app). 

## Live with Desire
You only live once. I wanna try to explore as much as the world in a open mindset. I believe that we should embrace and help people around us.
